This project considers whether a causal relationship exists between banning cell phones in Michigan public school districts and students' academic scores on standardized math tests. We used the Synthetic Control Method to analyze the impact cell phone bans had on student achievement. 

The SyntheticControlMethods package used in our code requires SciPy 1.4.1 which most likely is a downgrade for most users and requires the kernel to be restarted after the install.

Packages

Pip install SyntheticControlMethods

Pip install scipy==1.4.1
